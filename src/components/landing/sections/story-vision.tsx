              Traditional CRMs were built for a different era. We're creating
              the first true AI-native platform that automates the mundane and
              amplifies what humans do best: building meaningful relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
              By combining cutting-edge AI with decades of sales expertise,
              we've created a CRM that actually helps you sell better —
              predicting outcomes, suggesting next steps, and handling routine
              tasks automatically.
