## Key Execution Concepts

- **Topological Execution** - Blocks are executed in dependency order, ensuring data flows correctly
- **Path Tracking** - The system tracks active execution paths based on routing decisions
- **Loop Management** - Sophisticated loop handling allows for iterative processing with safeguards
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Watch your worker execute with detailed logs and visual indicators
- **Error Handling** - Robust error management keeps your workers resilient

Whether you're building simple automations or complex AI workers, understanding execution is key to creating effective solutions in nusoma.

## Execution Flow

When you execute a worker in nusoma, the system follows a predictable pattern:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Validation The worker is validated to ensure it has an enabled starter block and proper
    connections. This includes checking that: - The starter block has no incoming connections - All
    required blocks are present and properly connected - Loop configurations are valid with
    appropriate iteration limits
  </Step>

<Step>
  ### Initialization The execution context is created with environment variables and input values.
  This context maintains the state of the worker throughout execution, including: - Block outputs
  and states - Execution path tracking - Routing decisions - Loop iteration counters
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Block Execution Blocks are executed in topological order, with each block's outputs feeding
  into subsequent blocks. The executor: - Determines the next layer of blocks to execute based on
  dependencies - Resolves inputs for each block from previous outputs - Dispatches execution to
  specialized handlers for each block type
</Step>

<Step>
  ### Path Determination Router and conditional blocks make routing decisions that determine which
  execution paths to follow. The path tracker: - Updates the active execution path based on these
  decisions - Ensures that only blocks on active paths are executed - Handles complex branching
  logic in your worker
</Step>

  <Step>
    ### Result Collection The final output and execution logs are collected and presented in the UI.
    You'll see: - Complete execution logs for each block - Performance metrics and timing
    information - Any errors that occurred during execution - The final worker output
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Block Types

nusoma has two main categories of blocks in workers:

<Tabs items={['Orchestration Blocks', 'Output Blocks']}>
  <Tab value="Orchestration Blocks">
    <Card>
      Orchestration blocks control the flow of execution through your worker.
      <Files>
        <File
          name="Router Blocks"
          icon={<ConnectIcon className="h-4 w-4" />}
          annotation="Direct the worker along specific paths based on dynamic decisions. The router evaluates inputs and selects one of multiple possible paths."
        />
        <File
          name="Conditional Blocks"
          icon={<ConditionalIcon className="h-4 w-4" />}
          annotation="Execute different paths based on conditional logic. Conditions are evaluated to true or false, determining which path to follow."
        />
      </Files>

          annotation="Execute custom JavaScript/TypeScript code to process data. Runs in a secure sandbox environment with appropriate timeout limits."
        />
        <File
          name="API Blocks"
          icon={<ApiIcon className="h-4 w-4" />}
          annotation="Make HTTP requests to external services. Configure headers, body, and authentication for REST API interactions."
        />
        <File
          name="Evaluator Blocks"
          icon={<ChartBarIcon className="h-4 w-4" />}
          annotation="Assess outputs against defined criteria with customizable scoring logic."

## Real-Time Monitoring

As your worker executes, nusoma provides powerful real-time monitoring capabilities:

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Active Block Indicator">
    The currently executing block is highlighted in the worker editor, making it easy to follow
    the execution flow in real-time. This visual indicator helps you understand exactly where in
    your worker the execution is currently happening.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Live Logs Panel">
  Execution logs appear in real-time in the logs panel on the right side. These logs include
  detailed information about each block's execution, including inputs, outputs, execution time, and
  any errors that occur. You can use these logs to debug your worker and understand how data flows
  between blocks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Block States">
  Each block's state (pending, executing, completed, or error) is visually indicated in the worker
  editor. This helps you quickly identify which blocks have executed successfully and which may have
  encountered issues.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Metrics">
    Detailed timing information shows how long each block takes to execute, helping you identify
    performance bottlenecks in your worker. The execution engine tracks start time, end time, and
    total duration for both individual blocks and the entire worker.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Execution Methods

nusoma offers multiple ways to trigger worker execution:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Manual Execution" href="#">
    Run workers on-demand through the nusoma interface. This is perfect for testing and
    development, allowing you to iteratively refine your worker with immediate feedback.
  </Card>

<Card title="Scheduled Execution" href="#">
  Configure workers to run automatically on a specified schedule using cron expressions. Ideal for
  regular data processing, reporting tasks, or any worker that needs to run periodically without
  manual intervention.
</Card>

<Card title="API Endpoints" href="#">
  Each worker can be exposed as an API endpoint with authentication, allowing external systems to
  trigger execution with custom inputs. This enables seamless integration with your existing
  applications and services.
</Card>

  <Card title="Webhooks" href="#">
    Configure workers to execute in response to external events via webhook triggers. This allows
    your workers to react to events from third-party services like GitHub, Stripe, or any platform
    that supports webhooks.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Advanced Execution Features

### Loops

nusoma supports sophisticated loop constructs, allowing parts of your worker to execute repeatedly:

- **Iteration Limits** - Configure maximum iterations (default: 5) to prevent infinite loops and minimum iterations to ensure the loop executes a certain number of times.
- **Conditional Looping** - Continue looping until specific conditions are met, with the loop manager tracking iteration counts.
- **Loop Reset** - Automatically resets block states between iterations, allowing blocks to be re-executed with updated inputs.
- **Feedback Paths** - Create feedback loops where outputs from later blocks feed back into earlier blocks in the worker.

### Error Handling

The execution engine includes built-in error handling mechanisms:

- **Block-Level Errors** - Errors in one block don't necessarily stop the entire worker execution.
- **Detailed Error Logs** - Comprehensive error information is captured in the execution logs, including error messages, stack traces, and relevant context.
- **Fallback Mechanisms** - For function execution, the system tries Freestyle execution first, then falls back to VM execution if needed.
- **Recovery Options** - Configure blocks to retry on failure or implement custom error handling logic.

### Environment Variables

Use environment variables to securely store and access sensitive information:

- **API Keys** - Store API credentials securely without hardcoding them in your worker.
- **Configuration Values** - Manage environment-specific configuration values.
- **Runtime Availability** - All environment variables are available to blocks during execution.
- **Secure Storage** - Values are encrypted at rest and only decrypted during execution.

## Execution Context

Each worker execution maintains a detailed context that includes:

- **Block States** - Outputs and execution status of each block, indexed by block ID.
- **Execution Path** - The active path through the worker based on routing decisions.
- **Routing Decisions** - Records which paths were selected by router and conditional blocks.
- **Loop Iterations** - Tracks current iteration count for each loop in the worker.
- **Environment Variables** - Configuration values available to all blocks during execution.
- **Execution Logs** - A chronological record of block executions with timing information.

## Performance Considerations

- **Block Complexity** - Complex blocks with heavy computation may take longer to execute. Consider breaking complex operations into multiple blocks.
- **External Dependencies** - Blocks that rely on external services may be affected by network latency or service availability.
- **Execution Layers** - The executor processes blocks in layers based on dependencies, which can affect overall execution time.
- **Code Optimization** - For function blocks, optimize your code to reduce execution time and resource usage.
- **Timeout Limits** - Function blocks have configurable timeout limits to prevent long-running operations from blocking execution.

By understanding these execution principles, you can design more efficient and effective workers in nusoma.
